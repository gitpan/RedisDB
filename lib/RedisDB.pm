=head1 NAME

RedisDB - Perl extension to access redis database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use RedisDB;

    my $redis = RedisDB->new(host => 'localhost', port => 6379);
    $redis->set($key, $value);
    my $value = $redis->get($key);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides interface to access redis key-value store, it
transparently handles disconnects and forks, supports transactions,
pipelining, and subscription mode. Module includes XS and pure Perl
versions of the parser.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 $class->new(%options)

Creates the new RedisDB object. The following options are accepted:

=over 4

=item host

domain name of the host running redis server. Default: "localhost"

=item port

port to connect. Default: 6379

=item path

you can connect to redis using UNIX socket. In this case instead of
L</host> and L</port> you should specify I<path>.

=item password

Password, if redis server requires authentication. Alternatively you can use
I<auth> method after connection.

=item database

DB number to use. Specified database will be selected immediately after
connecting to the server. Database changes when you sending I<select> command
to the server. You can get current database using I<selected_database> method.
Default value is 0.

=item raise_error

By default if redis-server returned error reply, or there was a connection
error I<get_reply> method throws an exception of L<RedisDB::Error> type, if
you set this parameter to false it will return an error object instead. Note,
that if you have set this to false you must always check if the result you've
got from RedisDB is a L<RedisDB::Error> object.

=item timeout

IO timeout. With this option set, if IO operation has taken more than specified
number of seconds, module will croak or return L<RedisDB::Error::EAGAIN> error
object depending on L</raise_error> setting. Note, that some OSes do not
support SO_RCVTIMEO, and SO_SNDTIMEO socket options, in this case timeout will
not work.

=item utf8

Assume that all data on the server encoded in UTF-8. As result all strings will
be converted to UTF-8 before sending to server, and all results will be decoded
from UTF-8. See L</"UTF-8 SUPPORT">.

=item connection_name

After establishing connection set its name. See "CLIENT SETNAME" command
description in the redis documentation.

=item lazy

by default I<new> establishes connection to the server. If this parameter is
set, then connection will be established when you will send a command to the
server.

=item reconnect_attempts

this parameter allows you to specify how many attempts to (re)connect to the
server should be made before returning error. Default value is 1, set to -1 if
module should try to reconnect indefinitely.

=item reconnect_delay_max

module makes a delay before each new attempt to connect. Delay increases with
each new attempt. This parameter allows you to specify maximum delay between
attempts to reconnect. Default value is 10.

=item on_connect_error

this allows you to specify callback that will be invoked if module could not
establish connection to the server.  First argument to callback is a reference
to the RedisDB object, and second is the error description. You must not invoke
any methods on the object inside the callback, but you can change I<port> and
I<host>, or I<path> attributes of the I<RedisDB> object to point to another
server.  After callback returned, module tries to establish connection again
using new parameters. To prevent further connection attempts callback should
throw an exception. Default callback confesses. This may be useful to switch to
backup server if primary went down. RedisDB distribution includes an example of
using this callback in eg/server_failover.pl.

=head2 $self->execute($command, @arguments)

send a command to the server and return the result. It will throw an exception
if the server returns an error or return L<RedisDB::Error> depending on
L</raise_error> parameter. It may be more convenient to use instead of this
method wrapper named after the corresponding redis command. E.g.:

    $redis->execute('set', key => 'value');
    # is the same as
    $redis->set(key => 'value');

See L</"WRAPPER METHODS"> section for the full list of defined aliases.

Note, that you can't use I<execute> if you have sent some commands using
I<send_command> method without callback argument and have not yet got all
replies.

send a command to the server. If send has failed command will die or return

does not return reply from the server, you should retrieve it using the
I<get_reply> method, or if I<callback> has been specified, it will be invoked
upon receiving the reply with two arguments: the RedisDB object, and the reply
from the server.  If the server returns an error, the second argument to the
callback will be a L<RedisDB::Error> object, you can get description of the
error using this object in string context.  If you are not interested in reply,
you can use RedisDB::IGNORE_REPLY constant as the last argument.

Note, that RedisDB does not run any background threads, so it will not receive
the reply and invoke the callback unless you call some of its methods which
check if there are replies from the server, like I<send_command>,
I<reply_ready>, I<get_reply>, or I<get_all_replies>.

=head2 $self->send_command_cb($command[, @arguments][, \&callback])

send a command to the server, invoke specified I<callback> on reply. The
callback is invoked with two arguments: the RedisDB object, and reply from the
server.  If the server returned an error, the second argument will be a
L<RedisDB::Error> object, you can get description of the error using this
object in string context.  If the I<callback> is not specified, the reply will
be discarded.  Note, that RedisDB does not run any background threads, so it
will not receive the reply and invoke the callback unless you call some of its
methods which check if there are replies from the server, like I<send_command>,
I<send_command_cb>, I<reply_ready>, I<get_reply>, or I<get_all_replies>.

B<DEPRECATED:> this method is deprecated and may be removed in some future
version. Please use I<send_command> method instead. If you are using
I<send_command_cb> with I<&callback> argument, you can just replace the method
with I<send_command> and it will do the same. If you are using
I<send_command_cb> with the default callback, you should add the
RedisDB::IGNORE_REPLY constant as the last argument when replacing the method
with I<send_command>.  Here is the example that shows equivalents with
I<send_command>:

    $redis->send_command_cb("SET", "Key", "Value");
    # may be replaced with
    $redis->send_command("SET", "Key", "Value", RedisDB::IGNORE_REPLY);

    $redis->send_command_cb("GET", "Key", \&process_reply);

=head2 $self->reply_ready

This method may be used in the pipelining mode to check if there are some
replies already received from the server. Returns the number of replies
available for reading. May also return L<RedisDB::Error> object if there was a
network error and I<raise_error> is disabled.

this method blocks till all replies from the server will be received. Note,
that callbacks for some replies may send new requests to the server and so this
method may block for indefinite time.

=head1 WRAPPER METHODS

Instead of using I<execute> and I<send_command> methods directly, it may be
more convenient to use wrapper methods with names matching names of the redis
commands. These methods call I<execute> or I<send_command> depending on the
presence of the callback argument. If callback is specified, the method invokes
I<send_command> and returns as soon as the command has been sent to the server;
when the reply is received, it will be passed to the callback (see
L</"PIPELINING SUPPORT">). If there is no callback, the method invokes
I<execute>, waits for the reply from the server, and returns it. E.g.:

    $val = $redis->get($key);
    # equivalent to
    $val = $redis->execute("get", $key);

    $redis->get($key, sub { $val = $_[1] });
    # equivalent to
    $redis->send_command("get", $key, sub { $val = $_[1] });

The following wrapper methods are defined: append, auth, bgrewriteaof, bgsave,
bitcount, bitop, bitpos, blpop, brpop, brpoplpush, client, client_kill,
client_getname, client_setname, config, config_get, config_set,

=head2 $self->info([$callback])

return information and statistics about the server. Redis-server returns

=head2 $self->client_list([$callback])

return list of clients connected to the server. This method parses server
output and returns result as reference to array of hashes.

    }
    return $res;
}

=head2 $self->shutdown

Shuts the redis server down. Returns undef, as the server doesn't send the
answer.  Croaks in case of the error.

=cut

sub shutdown {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->send_command_cb( 'SHUTDOWN', @_ );
    return;
}

=head2 $self->scan_all([MATCH => $pattern,][COUNT => $count,])

this method starts a new SCAN iteration and executes SCAN commands till cursor
returned by server is 0. It then returns all the keys returned by server during
the iteration. MATCH and COUNT are passed to SCAN command. In case of success
returns reference to array with matching keys, in case of error dies or returns
L<RedisDB::Error> object depending on I<raise_error> option.

=cut

sub scan_all {
    my $self = shift;
    if ( ref $_[-1] eq 'CODE' ) {
        croak "scan_all does not accept callback parameter";
    }

    my @result;
    do {
        my $res = $self->execute( 'SCAN', $cursor, @_ );

        # in case of error just return it
        return $res unless ref $res eq 'ARRAY';
        $cursor = $res->[0];
        push @result, @{ $res->[1] };
    } while $cursor;
    return \@result;
}

=head2 $self->sscan_all($key, [MATCH => $pattern,][COUNT => $count,])

=head2 $self->zscan_all($key, [MATCH => $pattern,][COUNT => $count,])

these three methods are doing the same thing as I<scan_all> except that they
require a key as the first parameter, and they iterate using HSCAN, SSCAN and
ZSCAN commands.

=cut

for my $command (qw(hscan sscan zscan)) {
    my $uccom = uc $command;
    no strict 'refs';
    my $name = "${command}_all";

            croak "$name does not accept callback parameter";
        }
        my $cursor = 0;
        my @result;
        do {
            my $res = $self->execute( $uccom, $key, $cursor, @_ );
            return $res unless ref $res eq 'ARRAY';
            $cursor = $res->[0];
            push @result, @{ $res->[1] };
        } while $cursor;
        return \@result;
    };
}

=head1 UTF-8 SUPPORT

The redis protocol is designed to work with the binary data, both keys and
values are encoded in the same way as sequences of octets.  By default this
module expects all data to be just strings of bytes. There is an option to
treat all data as UTF-8 strings. If you pass I<utf8> parameter to the
constructor, module will encode all strings to UTF-8 before sending them to
server, and will decode all strings received from server from UTF-8. This has
following repercussions you should be aware off: first, you can't store binary
data on server with this option on, it would be treated as a sequence of latin1
characters, and would be converted into a corresponding sequence of UTF-8
encoded characters; second, if data returned by the server is not a valid UTF-8
encoded string, the module will croak, and you will have to reinitialize the
connection. The parser only checks for invalid UTF-8 byte sequences, it doesn't
check if input contains invalid code points. Generally, using this option is
not recommended.

=cut

=head1 ERROR HANDLING

If L</raise_error> parameter was set to true in the constructor (which is
default setting), then module will throw an exception in case network IO
function returned an error, or if redis-server returned an error reply. Network
exceptions belong to L<RedisDB::Error::EAGAIN> or
L<RedisDB::Error::DISCONNECTED> class, if redis-server returned an error
exception will be of L<RedisDB::Error> class. If the object was in subscription
mode, you will have to restore all the subscriptions. If the object was in the
middle of transaction, when after network error you will have to start the
transaction again.

If L</raise_error> parameter was disabled, then instead of throwing an
exception, module will return exception object and also pass this exception
object to every callback waiting for the reply from the server. If the object
is in subscription mode, then module will automatically restore all
subscriptions after reconnect. Note, that during transaction L</raise_error> is
always enabled, so any error will throw an exception.

=cut

=head1 HANDLING OF SERVER DISCONNECTS

Redis server may close a connection if it was idle for some time, also the
connection may be closed in case when redis-server was restarted, or just
because of the network problem. RedisDB always tries to restore connection to
the server if no data has been lost as a result of disconnect, and if
L</raise_error> parameter disabled it will try to reconnect even if disconnect
happened during data transmission.  E.g. if the client was idle for some time
and the redis server closed the connection, it will be transparently restored
when you send a command next time no matter if L</raise_error> enabled or not.
If you sent a command and the server has closed the connection without sending
a complete reply, then module will act differently depending on L</raise_error>
value.  If L</raise_error> enabled, the module will cancel all current
callbacks, reset the object to the initial state, and throw an exception of
L<RedisDB::Error::DISCONNECTED> class, next time you use the object it will
establish a new connection. If L</raise_error> disabled, the module will pass
L<RedisDB::Error::DISCONNECTED> object to all outstanding callbacks and will
try to reconnect to the server; it will also automatically restore
subscriptions if object was in subscription mode. Module never tries to
reconnect after MULTI command was sent to server and before corresponding EXEC
or DISCARD was sent as this may cause data corruption, so during transaction
module behaves like if L</raise_error> is set.

Module makes several attempts to reconnect each time increasing interval before
the next attempt, depending on the values of L</reconnect_attempts> and
L</reconnect_delay_max>. After each failed attempt to connect module will
invoke L</on_connect_error> callback which for example may change redis-server
hostname, so on next attempt module will try to connect to different server.

=cut

=head1 PIPELINING

You can send commands in the pipelining mode. It means you are sending multiple
commands to the server without waiting for the replies.  This is implemented by
the I<send_command> method. Recommended way of using it is to pass a reference
to the callback function as the last argument.  When module receives reply from
the server, it will call this function with two arguments: reference to the
RedisDB object, and reply from the server. It is important to understand
though, that RedisDB does not run any background threads, neither it checks for
the replies by setting some timer, so e.g. in the following example callback
will never be invoked:

    my $pong;
    $redis->send_command( "ping", sub { $pong = $_[1] } );
    sleep 1 while not $pong;    # this will never return

Therefore you need periodically trigger check for the replies. The check is
triggered when you call the following methods: I<send_command>, I<reply_ready>,
I<get_reply>, I<get_all_replies>.  Calling wrapper method, like
C<< $redis->get('key') >>, will also trigger check as internally wrapper methods
use methods listed above.

Also you can omit callback argument when invoke I<send_command>. In this case
you have to fetch reply later explicitly using I<get_reply> method. This is how
synchronous I<execute> is implemented, basically it is:

    sub execute {
        my $self = shift;
        $self->send_command(@_);
        return $self->get_reply;
    }

That is why it is not allowed to call I<execute> unless you have got replies to
all commands sent previously with I<send_command> without callback. Using
I<send_command> without callback is not recommended.

Sometimes you are not interested in replies sent by the server, e.g. SET
command usually just return 'OK', in this case you can pass to I<send_command>
callback which ignores its arguments, or use C<RedisDB::IGNORE_REPLY> constant, it
is a no-op function:

    for (@keys) {
        # execute will not just send 'GET' command to the server,
        # but it will also receive response to the 'SET' command sent on
        # the previous loop iteration
        my $val = $redis->execute( "get", $_ );
        $redis->send_command( "set", $_, fun($val), RedisDB::IGNORE_REPLY );
    }
    # and this will wait for the last reply
    $redis->mainloop;

or using L</"WRAPPER METHODS"> you can rewrite it as:

    for (@keys) {
        my $val = $redis->get($_);
        $redis->set( $_, fun($val), RedisDB::IGNORE_REPLY );
    }
    $redis->mainloop;

=cut

=head1 PUB/SUB MESSAGING

RedisDB supports subscriptions to redis channels. In the subscription mode you
can subscribe to some channels and receive all the messages sent to these
channels. You can subscribe to channels and then manually check messages using
I<get_reply> method, or you can invoke I<subscription_loop> method, which will
block in loop waiting for messages and invoking callback for each received
message.  In the first case you can use I<subscribe> and I<psubscribe> methods
to subscribe to channels and then you can use I<get_reply> method to get
messages from the channel:

    $redis->subscribe(
        foo => sub {
            my ( $redis, $channel, $patern, $message ) = @_;
            print "Foo: $message\n";
        }
    );
    # Wait for messages
    $res = $redis->get_reply;

I<get_reply> method for messages from the channel will invoke callback
specified as the second optional argument of the I<subscribe> method and will
also return raw replies from the server, both for messages from the channels
and for informational messages from the redis server. If you do not want to
block in I<get_reply> method, you can check if there are any messages using
I<reply_ready> method.

In the second case you invoke I<subscription_loop> method, it subscribes to
specified channels and waits for messages, when a message arrived it invokes
callback defined for the channel from which the message came. Here is an
example:

    my $message_cb = sub {
        my ( $redis, $channel, $pattern, $message ) = @_;
        print "$channel: $message\n";
    };

    my $control_cb = sub {
        my ( $redis, $channel, $pattern, $message ) = @_;
        if ( $channel eq 'control.quit' ) {
            $redis->unsubscribe;
            $redis->punsubscribe;
        }
        elsif ( $channel eq 'control.subscribe' ) {
            $redis->subscribe($message);
        }
    };

    $redis->subscription_loop(
        subscribe        => [ 'news', ],
        psubscribe       => [ 'control.*' => $control_cb ],
        default_callback => $message_cb,
    );

subscription_loop will subscribe you to the "news" channel and "control.*"
channels. It will call specified callbacks every time a new message received.
When message came from "control.subscribe" channel, callback subscribes to an
additional channel. When message came from "control.quit" channel, callback
unsubscribes from all channels.

Callbacks used in subscription mode receive four arguments: the RedisDB object,
the channel from which the message came, the pattern if you subscribed to this
channel using I<psubscribe> method, and the message itself.

Once you switched into subscription mode using either I<subscribe> or
I<psubscribe> command, or by entering I<subscription_loop>, you only can send
I<subscribe>, I<psubscribe>, I<unsubscribe>, and I<punsubscribe> commands to
the server, other commands will throw an exception.

You can publish messages into the channels using the I<publish> method. This
method should be called when you in the normal mode, and can't be used while
you're in the subscription mode.

Following methods can be used in subscription mode:

=cut

=head2 $self->subscription_loop(%parameters)

Enter into the subscription mode. The method subscribes you to the specified
channels, waits for the messages, and invokes the appropriate callback for
every received message. The method returns after you unsubscribed from all the
channels. It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4

=item default_callback

reference to the default callback. This callback is invoked for a message if you
didn't specify other callback for the channel this message comes from.

=item subscribe

an array reference. Contains the list of channels you want to subscribe. A
channel name may be optionally followed by the reference to a callback function
for this channel.  E.g.:

    [ 'news', 'messages', 'errors' => \&error_cb, 'other' ]

channels "news", "messages", and "other" will use default callback, but for
the "errors" channel error_cb function will be used.

=item psubscribe

same as subscribe, but you specify patterns for channels' names.

=back

All parameters are optional, but you must subscribe at least to one channel. Also
if default_callback is not specified, you have to explicitly specify a callback
for every channel you are going to subscribe.

=head1 TRANSACTIONS

Transactions allow you to execute a sequence of commands in a single step. In
order to start a transaction you should use the I<multi> method.  After you
have entered a transaction all the commands you issue are queued, but not
executed till you call the I<exec> method. Typically these commands return
string "QUEUED" as a result, but if there is an error in e.g. number of
arguments, they may return an error. When you call exec, all the queued
commands will be executed and exec will return a list of results for every
command in the transaction. If instead of I<exec> you call I<discard>, all
scheduled commands will be canceled.

You can set some keys as watched. If any watched key has been changed by
another client before you called exec, the transaction will be discarded and
exec will return false value.

=cut

=head2 $self->multi([\&callback])

Enter the transaction. After this and till I<exec> or I<discard> will be called,
all the commands will be queued but not executed.

=cut

sub multi {
    my $self = shift;

    die "Multi calls can not be nested!" if $self->{_in_multi};
    $self->{_in_multi} = 1;
    if ( ref $_[-1] eq 'CODE' ) {
        return $self->send_command( 'MULTI', @_ );
    }
    else {
        return $self->execute('MULTI');
    }
}

=head2 $self->exec([\&callback])

Execute all queued commands and finish the transaction. Returns a list of
results for every command. Will croak if some command has failed.  Also
unwatches all the keys. If some of the watched keys has been changed by other
client, the transaction will be canceled and I<exec> will return false.

=cut

sub exec {
    my $self = shift;

    my $res;
    if ( ref $_[-1] eq 'CODE' ) {
        $res = $self->send_command( 'EXEC', @_ );
    }
    else {
        $res = $self->execute('EXEC');
    }
    $self->{_in_multi} = undef;
    return $res;
}

=head2 $self->discard([\&callback])

Discard all queued commands without executing them and unwatch all keys.

=cut

sub discard {
    my $self = shift;

    my $res;
    if ( ref $_[-1] eq 'CODE' ) {
        $res = $self->send_command( 'DISCARD', @_ );

=head1 WHY ANOTHER ONE

I was in need of the client for redis database. L<AnyEvent::Redis> didn't suite
me as it requires an event loop, and it didn't fit into the existing code. The
problem with L<Redis> is that it didn't (at the time I started this) reconnect
to the server if connection was closed after timeout or as result of the server
restart, and it does not support pipelining. After analyzing what I need to
change in L<Redis> in order to get all I want, I decided that it will be
simpler to write the new module from scratch. This also solves the problem of
backward compatibility.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests via GitHub bug tracker at
L<http://github.com/trinitum/RedisDB/issues>.

Known bugs are:

Timeout support is OS dependent. If OS doesn't support SO_SNDTIMEO and SO_RCVTIMEO
options timeouts will not work.

QUIT command doesn't work with redis-server before version 2.0

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Sanko Robinson and FunkyMonk helped me with porting this module to Windows.

HIROSE Masaake fixed handling of commands containing space (like "CONFIG GET")
